  "writing_sample": "Last summer, I interned at TechCorp where I led a small team to build a user engagement feature. The project was challenging because we had only 8 weeks and unclear requirements. I started by setting up weekly check-ins with our PM to clarify priorities. Then I broke down the work into 2-week sprints and assigned tasks based on each person's strengths. When we hit a major technical blocker in week 4, I made the call to simplify our approach rather than risk missing the deadline. It was a tough decision because it meant cutting a feature we were excited about, but it was the right choice. We shipped on time, and the feature drove a 35% increase in daily active users. The experience taught me that sometimes good enough and on-time beats perfect and late. I also learned the importance of clear communication - I held daily standups and made sure everyone knew how their work connected to the bigger goal. The team gave me positive feedback about my leadership, especially around creating a collaborative environment where everyone felt heard."
